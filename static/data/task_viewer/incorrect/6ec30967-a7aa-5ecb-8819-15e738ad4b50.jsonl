{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In this setup, a human\\nexpert controls the robot, e.g., using tele-operation interfaces, and demonstrates solutions to com-\\nplex tasks. Leveraging human expertise, IL algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in\\ntraining robots to perform a wide range of complex tasks with finesse (Brohan et al., 2022; Zhao\\net al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). However, learning from human data is challenging due to the\\ninherent diversity in human behavior (Grauman et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2020). This diversity,\\narising from factors such as individual preferences, noise, varying levels of expertise, and different\\nproblem-solving approaches, poses a formidable hurdle for existing imitation learning algorithms.\\nIn recent years, there has been a notable surge of interest in the development of methods aimed at\\ncapturing diverse behaviors (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023). These\\nendeavors are driven by various objectives, including improving generalization capabilities (Merel\\net al., 2018; Li et al., 2017), enhancing skill transfer between policies (Merel et al., 2018; Kumar\\net al., 2020), and gaining advantages in competitive games (Celik et al., 2022), among others. Nev-\\nertheless, these approaches are often tested on synthetically generated datasets, datasets with limited\\n\\u2217Correspondence to xiaogang.jia@kit.edu\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nD4RL\\nRobomimic\\nT-Shape\\nRelay Kitchen\\nBlock-Push\\nD3IL (ours)\\nHuman Demonstrations\\nState Data\\nVisual Data\\nDiverse Behavior\\nQuant.

Other datasets are collected directly on\\nreal robot platforms and lack simulation environments that can be used for benchmarking other al-\\ngorithms. While real robot environments are of course preferable to show the applicability of the\\napproaches on the real system, they hinder benchmarking new algorithms against the reported re-\\nsults as that would require rebuilding the real robot setup, which is often infeasible. Furthermore,\\nthe majority of existing studies do not provide metrics to quantitatively measure a model\\u2019s ability to\\nreplicate diverse behaviors, often relying solely on qualitative analysis (Shafiullah et al., 2022).\\nTo address these challenges, this work introduces benchmark environments and the corresponding\\nDatasets with Diverse Human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL). Our primary aim is\\nto provide a comprehensive evaluation framework that explicitly assesses an algorithm\\u2019s ability to\\nlearn from multi-modal data distributions. We have designed these datasets to encompass the rich-\\nness and variability inherent in human behavior, offering more realistic and challenging benchmark\\nscenarios for imitation learning. Moreover, the given environments are challenging as the behavior is\\ncomposed of multiple sub-tasks and they require policies that heavily rely on closed-loop feedback.\\nTo tackle the intricate problem of quantifying a model\\u2019s capacity to capture and replicate diverse\\nhuman behaviors, we introduce tractable metrics. These metrics provide valuable insights into a\\nmodel\\u2019s versatility and adaptability, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of imitation learning\\nalgorithms\\u2019 performance.\\nFurthermore, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of state-of-the-art imitation learning methods using\\nthe D3IL task suite. This evaluation serves as a benchmark for assessing the capability of these\\nmethods to learn diverse behaviors, shedding light on their effectiveness, hyper-parameter choices,\\nand the representations they employ by. By analyzing their performance for these realistic human-\\ngenerated datasets in challenging environments. Here, our analysis includes different backbones of\\nthe different IL architectures (MLPs and various versions of transformers), different ways to capture\\nthe multi-modality of the action distribution (clustering, VAEs, IBC, various versions of diffusion).\\nMoreover, we analyze the performance using the direct state observations or image observations as\\ninput to the policies and draw conclusions on the benefits and drawbacks of these representations.\\nFinally, we evaluate which method can deal best with small datasets.

Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the distinctive fea-\\ntures that set our work apart from the most closely related benchmarks in the field.\\nRLBench (James et al., 2020) and ManiSkill2 (Mu et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2023) are two recent\\nlarge-scale benchmarks for robot learning with a large variety of tasks with both, proprioceptive\\nand visual data. However, the demonstrations are generated through motion planning and are hence\\nlacking diversity. Meta-World is another robot learning benchmark with 50 different tasks and a\\nfocus on multi-task reinforcement learning (Yu et al., 2020). Yet, no human demonstrations exists\\nfor these tasks and most tasks typically only have one solution. D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) proposed\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstandardized environments and datasets for offline reinforcement learning with various tasks. Sev-\\neral other benchmarks specialize in areas such as language-guided multitask learning in simulation\\n(Mees et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Gong\\net al., 2023), continual learning (Liu et al., 2023) and diverse multi-task real world skill learning\\n(Walke et al., 2023; Bharadhwaj et al., 2023; Heo et al., 2023). A benchmark with a focus on human\\ndemonstrations is Robomimic (Mandlekar et al., 2021), featuring 8 different task in simulation and\\nreal world environments. The demonstrations, collected by multiple people with various degrees of\\nexpertise using the RoboTurk framework (Mandlekar et al., 2018). Yet, the tasks where not designed\\nto show diverse behavior and consequently, non of the tested algorithms was designed to capture the\\ndiversity of the behavior.\\nThe benchmarks most closely related to D3IL are Block-Push (Florence et al., 2022; Shafiullah\\net al., 2022), T-Shape Pushing (Florence et al., 2022) and Relay Kitchen Gupta et al. (2019). While\\nBlock-Push has 4 different modalities, the behavior is generated by a scripted policy and is hence\\nlacking variance and fall-back solutions in the dataset. T-Shape tasks are limited to a maximum of\\ntwo modalities. The Relay Kitchen environment (Gupta et al., 2019) contains 7 different tasks with\\nhuman demonstrations that solve four tasks in sequence but does not require closed-loop sensory\\nfeedback. Further, several recent work have shown to achieve nearly optimal performance (Chi\\net al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) on these benchmarks, limiting further progress in these environments.\\nMoreover, none of the mentioned benchmarks offer metrics to evaluate the diversity of the learned\\nbehavior.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Datasets with Diverse Demonstrations for Imitation Learning\",\"section_content\":\"DATASETS WITH DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IMITATION LEARNING\\nIn this section, we present a novel suite of tasks known as D3IL - Datasets with Diverse Demon-\\nstrations for Imitation Learning. We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Children naturally develop an understanding of every individual\\u2019s unique mental state and how it might impact their actions (Frith et al., 2003). Known as Theory of Mind (ToM) (Premack and Woodruff, 1978), this ability is crucial for effcient and effective communication.\\nAlice and Bob are in a room with a basket and a box. Alice puts some celery in the basket and leaves the room. Bob then moves the celery into the box.\\nWhere will Bob search for the celery? (\\\\*) Where does Bob think that Alice will look for the celery when she returns? (\\\\*\\\\*)\\nCognitive and literary studies have extensively argued theory of mind\\u2019s key role in understanding stories, in order to explain and predict each character\\u2019s actions (Zunshine, 2006; Carney et al., 2014; Leverage et al., 2010; van Duijn et al., 2015, inter alia). As exemplifed in Figure 1, readers need to model Bob\\u2019s mental state (called frst-order ToM), as well as Bob\\u2019s estimation of Alice\\u2019s mental state (second-order ToM) to answer questions.\\nDespite recent progress in language understanding abilities, large language models have been shown to lack theory of mind skills (Sap et al., 2022). Existing efforts to enable them have primarily relied on supervised methods (e.g., Grant et al.,\\n2017; Nematzadeh et al., 2018; Arodi and Cheung, 2021). However, current reading comprehension datasets for theory of mind reasoning are simplistic and lack diversity, leading to brittle downstream models which, as we show, fail in the presence of even slight out-of-distribution perturbations.\\nWe introduce SYMBOLICTOM, an inferencetime method that improves large language models theory of mind capabilities by augmenting them with an explicit symbolic graphical representation of each character\\u2019s beliefs. Unlike prior efforts, our approach does not require training and instead divides the problem into simpler subtasks, leveraging off-the-shelf models to solve them, and carefully consolidating their results. This makes SYMBOLICTOM signifcantly more robust than existing models trained specifcally for theory of mind behavior.\\nWhile beliefs about the world state differ among people, most existing work on encoding belief states do not model this behavior relying on singular graphs (Jansen, 2022; Jacqmin et al., 2022). SYMBOLICTOM, instead, utilizes a set of graphs, each representing what the character $p_{1}$ thinks that $p_{2}$ believes that $\\\\left[...\\\\right]\\\\mathrm{~\\\\}p_{m}$ assumes to be the current state of the world, where $m$ is the maximum reasoning depth as determined by the user. This explicit, recursive mental state representation enables the model to answer questions from the perspective of each character. SYMBOLICTOM\\u2019s process of selecting and querying a particular character\\u2019s graph grounds it in cognitive science research arguing theory of mind as an essential mechanism of selective attention (Leslie et al., 2004). Our approach also instills desirable inductive biases, such as object permanence\\u2014for example, object locations (represented by edges in the graphs) are assumed to be constant until the method can infer a change. Although existing NLP datasets only test up to second-order reasoning (i.e., $m\\\\,\\\\leq\\\\,2,$ , SYMBOLICTOM is designed to work at any depth.\\nSYMBOLICTOM dramatically improves the performance of large language models in theory of mind reading comprehension tasks. For example, GPT-3-Davinci\\u2019s (Brown et al., 2020) accuracy on the ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019) increases by 38 absolute points using SYMBOLICTOM (yielding $92\\\\%$ accuracy averaging across question types). Furthermore, we extend the ToMi test sets with diverse story structures and sentence paraphrases and demonstrate that our approach is signifcantly more robust than supervised approaches.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Motivation and Background\",\"section_content\":\"Although large-scale language models have recently shown improvements in some classic theory of mind examples, they are still far from reliably showing theory of mind capabilities (Sap et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Ullman, 2023; Shapira et al., 2023). While the training data for these models includes human-written stories which require theory of mind reasoning, this information is largely implicit and hence diffcult for models to learn. ChatGPT and GPT3-Davinci\\u2019s incorrect answers to Figure 1\\u2019s question #2 are shown below.1\\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo): Based on the information provided, Bob would likely think that Alice will look for the celery in the box when she returns. Since Bob moved the celery from the basket to the box, he would assume that Alice would expect to fnd it in its new location. GPT3 (text-davinci-003): Bob will likely think that Alice will look for the celery in the box, since that is where he moved it.\\nNatural stories which make theory of mind explicit are scarce, necessitating automatically generated, template-based datasets like ToM-bAbI (Nematzadeh et al., 2018) and ToMi (Le et al., 2019). However, templated narratives cover limited types of interactions, and include only simplistic discourse and sentence structures. On the other hand, relying on human-generated data, e.g., in situated dialogue (Bara et al., 2021), leads to barriers in dataset size due to high annotation costs. Moreover, another source of data\\u2014text-based games with multiple characters\\u2014also faces limitations; in particular, modeling mental states is required mainly to infer intents (Zhou et al., 2022) and to maintain a consistent style of each character (Qiu et al., 2022). Rather, in this work, we aim to study and evaluate differences in knowledge and beliefs among multiple characters, traditional cognitive aspects of theory of mind.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only available datasets for measuring theory of mind in reading comprehension tasks are ToM-bAbI and ToMi. Because of their templated nature, supervised training on them is prone to overftting to spurious artifacts in the data. While ToMi was developed to counter this behavior in ToM-bAbI by introducing noise in the form of fexible sentence ordering and distractor sentences and characters, we show it still faces the same pitfalls.\\nFigure 2: Pipeline overview of SYMBOLICTOM, a decoding-time algorithm that enhances large language models\\u2019 theory of mind capabilities. SYMBOLICTOM does not require training: it divides the problem into smaller subtasks and uses off-the-shelf models to solve them. Given a passage, SYMBOLICTOM constructs explicit symbolic graphical representations of each character\\u2019s belief states (step 1). To answer ToM questions, it retrieves relevant sentences from the graph (step 2) and then queries the LLM in a zero-shot manner (step 3).\\nDue to theory of mind\\u2019s inherently implicit nature and limited naturally available data, in this work, we argue against supervision as a way forward and instead call for unsupervised, or inference-time approaches that combine modern neural models and traditional symbolic algorithms.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"A.1 Detailed Description of Information Contained in Global Context $G$\",\"section_content\":\"In the main paper, we defne $G$ as a graph containing the true world state (as opposed to beliefs about the current world state).

Thus, information passed verbally would not be stored in the global context (e.g. someone speaking in a room is not observable after they fnished talking), and would instead be stored in the local contexts of the people that heard the speech.

For\\nalgorithms that do not use his-\\ntory (Sohn et al., 2015; Flo-\\nrence et al., 2022), a standard\\nMLP is used as backbone ar-\\nchitecture,\\nwhile for history-\\ndependent policies (Shafiullah\\net\\nal.,\\n2022;\\nPearce\\net\\nal.,\\n2023; Reuss et al., 2023; Chi\\net al., 2023) we use a causal\\nmasked Transformer Decoder\\n(GPT) based on the implemen-\\ntation of BeT (Shafiullah et al.,\\n2022) as backbone as this archi-\\ntecture has been also adopted by other recent approaches. In our experiments, we use a history of\\nk = 5. The second axis categorizes whether the algorithms are predicting only a single action or the\\nfuture action sequence (Zhao et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023), which has been recently introduced as\\n5\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\naction chunking which has been shown to improve performance in some tasks. For action chunking\\nmodels, we use a Transformer Encoder Decoder structure (T-EncDec) (Vaswani et al., 2017) based\\non the implementation of VAE-ACT (Zhao et al., 2023). The third axis categorizes how the algo-\\nrithms capture behavior diversity. Standard deterministic models are not able to do so, while more\\nrecent models use clustering (Shafiullah et al., 2022), VAEs (Zhao et al., 2023; Sohn et al., 2015),\\nimplicit models (Florence et al., 2022) as well as discrete-time (Pearce et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023),\\nor continuous time diffusion models (Reuss et al., 2023).

The full table of used algorithmic setups is\\ndepicted in Table 2. A more detailed description of all model architectures is given in Appendix C.\\n4.2\\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nWe briefly outline the most important aspects of our experimental setup.\\nEvaluation Protocol. To assess a model\\u2019s ability to capture diverse behavior, we propose the behav-\\nior entropy and the conditional behavior entropy (Section 3.1). For the former, we perform multiple\\nsimulations, from which we compute the model\\u2019s behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2). For the latter, we use\\na randomly sampled but fixed set of initial states s0 and perform multiple simulations for each s0\\nin order to compute the conditional behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0). Alongside the entropy, we also\\nreport the success rate which is the fraction of simulations that led to successful task completion.\\nState \\/ Observation Representation. For most experiments, we provide state representation and\\nimage observations. For the former, we use handcrafted features that work well empirically. For the\\nlatter, we used two different camera views, in-hand and front view with a 96 \\u00d7 96 image resolution.\\nWe follow Chi et al. (2023) and use a ResNet-18 architecture as an image encoder for all methods.\\nModel Selection. Model selection is challenging as the training objective does not coincide with\\ntask performance (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Paine et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021; Mandlekar et al., 2021).\\nMoreover, policy performance can exhibit substantial variations from one training epoch to another\\n(Mandlekar et al., 2021). For image-based experiments we evaluate the task performance frequently\\n(after every 1\\/10th of total training) and chose the model with the best task-performance. Due to\\nhigh-computational demand for simulation, we split the dataset into training (90%) and validation\\n(10%) and chose the model with the lowest validation loss for state-based experiments. We ensure\\nthat the training converges by using 500 epochs for state representation and 200 for image obser-\\nvations. We extensively tune the most important hyperparameters of all methods using Bayesian\\noptimization (Snoek et al., 2012). We report the mean and the standard deviation over six random\\nseeds for all experiments.\\n4.3\\nBENCHMARK USING STATE REPRESENTATION\\nWe present the results utilizing state representations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding\\nindividual state representations for the tasks can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of\\nthe performance and diversity across all methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nMultiple Strategies for Multi-Modal Behavior Learning. This section discusses various strate-\\ngies employed by different models for learning multi-modal behavior. Deterministic models like\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT have limitations in this regard since they can only generate a single solution\\ngiven an initial state s0. On the other hand, VAE-based models like VAE-State and VAE-ACT are\\ncapable of generating different behaviors, but they tend to exhibit low behavior entropy, presumably\\ndue to a phenomenon often referred to as \\u201dmode collapse\\u201d (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In contrast,\\nIBC, BeT, and diffusion-based models demonstrate the capacity to learn multi-modal distributions.\\nIBC, for instance, exhibits high diversity in tasks like Avoiding, Pushing, and Sorting-2, with en-\\ntropy levels slightly superior to DDPM-MLP. BeT is capable of learning diverse solutions for each\\ntask, but it comes with a significant performance drop when compared to the deterministic BC-GPT\\nbaseline. Notably, diffusion-based methods, especially those incorporating transformer backbones,\\nexcel in learning diverse behavior while maintaining strong performance across all tasks. To of-\\nfer additional insights, we include visual representations of the diverse solutions generated by each\\nmethod for the Avoiding task in Figure 10. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyper-\\nparameter sensitivity, which is discussed in Section B. This analysis provides a deeper understanding\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTable 3: Comparison between various Imitation Learning algorithms, some of which incorporate his-\\ntory (\\u2021), action chunking (\\u2020), or both using state representations (State Data) and image observations\\n(Visual Data).

Notably, our findings reveal\\nthat increasing the number of diffusion steps leads to a substantial enhancement in diversity while\\nmaintaining consistent task performance.\\nHistorical Inputs and Prediction Horizons are Important. A comparison of results between\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT, VAE-State and VAE-ACT, BeT-MLP and BeT, DDPM-MLP and DDPM-\\nGPT reveals a notable trend: transformer-based methods consistently outperform their MLP-based\\ncounterparts. In particular, DDPM-GPT achieves an average 21% improvement in success rate\\nacross Avoiding, Aligning, and Pushing tasks compared to DDPM-MLP. While DDPM-MLP ex-\\nhibits higher entropy on the Aligning task, it lags behind on other tasks. When comparing VAE-\\nMLP to VAE-ACT, VAE-ACT demonstrates a success rate improvement of over 30% on most tasks,\\nindicating its effectiveness in capturing diverse behaviors. More significantly, transformers that\\nincorporate historical inputs or prediction horizons demonstrate the ability to tackle challenging\\ntasks like Sorting-4 and Stacking. However, the combination of historical information with ex-\\ntended prediction horizons (DDPM-ACT) does not appear to provide substantial benefits compared\\nto DDPM-GPT, which does not predict future actions.\\nScaling to More Complex Tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods excel in tasks such as Avoid-\\ning, Aligning, and Pushing; however, a notable performance gap emerges in Sorting and Stacking\\ntasks. In the case of Sorting, scaling with an increasing number of objects proves challenging for\\nall methods.

Developing agents with theory of mind is requisite for a wide range of applications, including reading comprehension, tutoring, dialogue, personalization, and negotiation. For example, in reading comprehension settings (and broadly for natural language understanding), having a multi-level understanding of texts is crucial for providing meaningful and contextualized answers: stories often rely on theory of mind reasoning to create confict (e.g., in murder mysteries, drama, and romances, as in the fnal acts of Romeo and Juliet).\\nWe present SYMBOLICTOM, a plug-and-play method to enable theory of mind reasoning in language models via explicit symbolic representations in the form of nested belief states. SYMBOLICTOM requires no training or fne-tuning, a key aspect for a domain with scarce supervised data and limited success in learning from massive unlabeled text alone. With experiments on reading comprehension tasks, our approach demonstrates dramatic improvement in the accuracy of base language models, especially for false-belief scenarios.\\nWe also show that, in contrast to supervised methods, SYMBOLICTOM is highly robust to story perturbations and out-of-domain inputs where supervised methods suffer signifcant degradations (as in, e.g., Yu et al., 2022).5 Our results show the promise of augmenting neural language models with symbolic knowledge for improving their social reasoning skills. We leave to future work to investigate similar approaches for other types of social intelligence; as well as develop new datasets that cover a more diverse set of interactions.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Limitations\",\"section_content\":\"SYMBOLICTOM assumes stories are written chronologically, which may not hold for some human-written stories. This may be alleviated using time-stamping models like Faghihi and Kordjamshidi (2021). Furthermore, since we use off-theshelf models (WANLI (Liu et al., 2022) and OpenIE (Stanovsky et al., 2018)) to create and update the graphs, the presented approach may propagate errors as revealed in the linguistic diversity experiments. However, these issues can be largely alleviated by using more sophisticated models, even the LLMs like GPT3 themselves. We do not experiment with them due to budgetary restrictions.\\n\\nCurrently, all NLP datasets available for theory of mind reasoning describe Sally-Anne tests. In these datasets, the concept of large distances is absent, meaning that anyone specifed to be in a location is assumed to be a witness of the actions that occur there. This assumption can be violated in realistic settings. For example, \\u201cAnne is in the USA\\u201d does not imply she is a witness to every action happening in the USA. In future work, this approach can be improved by refning the witnesses detection algorithm to incorporate physical commonsense reasoning. We could also refne the witness detection algorithm by sampling paths between the inserted edge and each node referring to a person, to query an LM directly on that substory by asking if the person witnessed the action. To be able to test both of these ideas, we would need to obtain new theory of mind datasets with signifcantly more types of interactions and physical commonsense in the stories.\"}\n\nIn total, 3 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

Our model only requires multi-view posed images to train.

To evaluate our model\\u2019s cross-dataset generalization capability, we utilize a couple of datasets, including OmniObject3D (Wu et al., 2023), Google Scanned Objects (GSO) (Downs et al., 2022), Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) (Collins et al., 2022), Common Objects 3D (CO3D) (Reizenstein et al., 2021), and DTU (Aan\\u00e6s et al., 2016). For OmniObject3D, GSO, ABO datasets, we randomly choose 500 objects for assessing our model\\u2019s performance. For CO3D dataset, we use the 400 held-out captures provided by Rel$\\\\mathrm{Pose++}$ (Lin et al., 2023a), which covers 10 object categories. For DTU dataset, we take the 15 objects with manually annotated masks provided by IDR (Yariv et al., 2020); for each object, we randomly select 8 different combinations of four input views, resulting in a total of 120 different testing inputs.

To do so, we design a synthetic regression experiment for which we can calculate the\\nTHR. For ICL regression tasks, the PHR is a reliable predictor of the THR and robust to the choice of\\n\\u03f5 parameter value. Moreover, we observe that the accuracy of the PHR estimator is higher for smaller\\nICL dataset sizes.\\nWe then evaluate the PHR estimator on natural language ICL tasks using pre-trained large language\\nmodels (LLMs). In this setting, calculating the THR is not feasible, so we investigate two alternative\\nquestions: (1) does the PHR estimator accurately predict the model hallucination rate (defined below\\nin Section 3.2), and (2) can the PHR accurately predict the empirical error rate? The PHR estimator\\nreliably predicts the model hallucination rate, regardless of model performance on all ICL natural\\nlanguage tasks. Moreover, the estimator remains robust to different ICL dataset sizes and settings\\nof the \\u03f5 parameter. Additionally, the PHR estimator accurately predicts the empirical error rate of\\ngenerated responses when \\u03f5 is set to values greater than 0.5 and the LLM can perform the task better\\nthan a random classifier.\\n3.1\\nSynthetic regression tasks\\nWe implement a CGM trained on sequences of synthetic regression problems where the THR is\\navailable and compare the PHR estimates against the THR on new regression tasks.\\nFigure 2: In the first and third panes, we see the neural process\\u2019s generated outcomes for n = 2\\nand n = 100. The blue region is the true (1-\\u03f5)\\u2013likely set, while the purple is the likely set when\\nconditioned on the blue data points. The second and fourth panes are the corresponding measures of\\nthe PHR and THR across the domain.\\nSetup. We assume the true distribution of query-response pairs p(Dn) is generated by the following\\nfactorization:\\nR Qn\\ni=1\\n\\u0000R\\np(yi | xi, f) dP(xi)\\n\\u0001\\ndP(f), where p(f) is the distribution of randomly\\ndrawn MLPs with He initialization, p(xi) is the uniform distribution over [\\u22122, 2], and p(y | x, f)\\nfollows a normal distribution N(f(x), 0.1).\\nWe implement the model p\\u03b8(y | x, Dn) with a setup similar to a Conditional Neural Process [48] and\\nwith an architecture close to Llama 2 [42] modified to model sequences of continuous variables. We\\ntrain it using auto-regressive prediction, the standard for CGMs and LLMs. Training and test data are\\ngenerated over non-overlapping sets of generated sequences. Example training datasets are shown\\nin Figure 9a in Appendix F.1. Example datasets generated by the fit model when initialized with a\\nsingle random query x are shown in Figure 9b in Appendix F.1. The full model and dataset details\\nare given in Appendices E.1 and F.1, respectively.\\n6\\nIn our experiments, we set \\u03f5 = 0.05 so that a response y is considered a hallucination if it falls\\noutside the 95% confidence interval of a given sampled distribution conditioned on x. To compute\\nthe THR, we use the ground truth function f that generated the dataset, replace p(y | x, Dn) with\\np\\u03b8(y | x, Dn), and estimate the integral by sampling 2000 values from this latter distribution. This\\napproach is reasonable, as we ultimately care about the true probability of hallucinations when using\\nthe model p\\u03b8 to make predictions.\\n(a) PHR and THR vs. n\\n(b) Calibration: THR vs. PHR against different numbers of context examples\\nFigure 3: Synthetic data: (a) Plot of the average THR and PHR as a function of n. The THR and\\nPHR follow each other and decrease as the number of contextual examples n increases. (b) Plot of\\nthe estimated PHR vs the THR. Each point represents the predicted PHR and actual THR for a given\\ninstance. Perfect performance would have all points on the x = y. Results show the PHR closely\\napproximates THR, but performance degrades with context length.\\nResults. The first and third panels of Figure 2 show the model\\u2019s generated outcomes for n = 2\\nand n = 100, respectively. In these plots, the blue region represents the true (1-\\u03f5)\\u2013likely set for\\nthe response distribution of a specific random ReLU neural network. The purple region depicts the\\nmodel\\u2019s (1-\\u03f5)\\u2013likely set when conditioned on the blue data points and a query value x in the domain\\n[-2, 2]. As more context examples are provided, the confidence intervals narrow, and responses y are\\nincreasingly likely to fall within the blue region.\\nThe second and fourth panels of Figure 2 illustrate the THR and the PHR for x in the domain [-2, 2]\\nfor two settings of n. We set N \\u2212n to 100, M to 40, and K to 2000. On the left, dips in PHR and\\nhallucination probability at x = 0 and x = 1 correspond with the ground truth in-context examples.\\nIn the right panel, with a larger n, both the PHR and hallucination probability remain low across all\\nx values. Notably, the PHR and hallucination probability closely align throughout the domain. In\\nAppendix G.1, we demonstrate that these findings hold across various values of the \\u03f5 parameter.\\nIn Figure 3a, we present the PHR and THR plotted against various context lengths, where each is\\naveraged over 200 random test functions. For added interpretability, we report several metrics for\\nevaluating the PHR as a linear predictor of the THR, including the mean squared error (MSE), the\\nregression coefficient \\u03b2, the p-value testing the null hypothesis that \\u03b2 = 0, and the coefficient of\\ndetermination (R2).\\nAlthough the PHR aligns well with the THR, it tends to underestimate it, particularly as the number\\nof examples increases. This is also clear given the lower R2 values as the context length increases. To\\ninvestigate this further, Figure 3b visualizes individual PHR and THR predictions at different context\\nlengths by plotting PHR values on the x-axis and the corresponding THR values on the y-axis. For\\nsmall numbers of contextual examples, the PHR closely matches the THR, which is encouraging\\nsince accurately capturing the true probability of hallucination is crucial when few examples are\\navailable and errors are more likely.\\nDiscussion. The results confirm that our method closely recovers the target estimand. However,\\nthe PHR estimator underestimates the THR. We do not believe this is due to the Monte Carlo or\\ntruncation approximations, as initial experiments with varying M, K, and N values exhibited the\\nsame pattern. Rather, we consider two main factors that likely contribute to this underestimation.\\nFirst, differences between the learned distribution p\\u03b8(y | x, Dn) and the true distribution p(y | x, Dn)\\nlikely contribute to the bias. This is seen in the slight discrepancies in the confidence intervals in the\\nthird panel of Figure 2. It may also be due to other mismatches in our assumptions, such as the lack\\nof perfect exchangeability in the transformer architecture; even after training on permuted sequences,\\nthe architecture may not fully achieve exchangeability.\\n7\\nSecond, even if the PHR estimate were entirely accurate, it would still differ from THR, as they\\nrepresent distinct quantities. Therefore, some degree of bias is to be expected. We investigate this\\nquestion further in Appendix G.1.2 where we compare our estimate with an analytic version of the\\nPHR and find this problem is greatly reduced.\\nWe leave it to future work to rigorously quantify these differences and develop methods that can more\\naccurately align the learned and true distributions, particularly in scenarios with large context sizes.\\n3.2\\nNatural language tasks\\nHere we evaluate the posterior hallucination rate estimator on common natural language in-context\\nlearning tasks using the Llama-2 family of LLMs [42]. We also provide results for Gemma-2 9B in\\nAppendix G.2.1. We evaluate the PHR by comparing it against the empirical error rate and the model\\nhallucination rate (MHR), which we define below. These serve as proxies for the THR, which is no\\nlonger computable as we can\\u2019t access f\\u22c6for these examples.\\n(a) Model Hallucination Rate (MHR) and Posterior Hallucination Rate (PHR) with \\u03f5 = 0.05 as a function of the\\nnumber of in-context examples. PHR closely follows MHR for all tasks.\\n(b) Error Rate and PHR with \\u03f5 = 0.75. PHR matches the error rate for SST2, Subjective, and AG News.\\nHowever, for more difficult tasks like Medical QP and entailment tasks (RTE and WNLI), PHR is less accurate,\\nhighlighting the limitations of Llama-2-7b.\\nFigure 4: Performance Metrics for Llama-2-7b Across Tasks.\\nSetup. We consider tasks defined by six datasets: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST2) [49], Subjec-\\ntivity [50], AG News [6], Medical QP [51], RTE [52], and WNLI [53]. We filter out queries of length\\nlonger than 116 tokens. Descriptions of all data sets and pre-processing are given in Appendix F.2.\\nTo implement ICL for a given dataset, we sample a response-balanced training set of query\\/response\\npairs Dn = (xi, yi)n\\n1. We generate a response y from the predictive distribution given by an LLM\\np\\u03b8(y | x, Dn). We structure the prompt by adding strings to distinguish between inputs and labels.\\nAn example prompt from the Subjectivity dataset is shown in Appendix E.2.\\nEvaluation metrics. It is a challenge to assess the accuracy of the the posterior hallucination rate on\\nLLM tasks as we only have a one ground truth response for each query instead of the ground truth f\\u22c6.\\nOne evaluation metric to consider is the empirical error rate,\\nb\\nE(x, y; p\\u03b8, Dn) := 1\\nK\\nK\\nX\\ni=1\\n1{yi \\u0338= y},\\nyi \\u223cp\\u03b8(\\u00b7 | x, Dn).\\n(9)\\nHowever, this metric only provides a partial picture as it does not account for the inherent variability\\nover responses given a mechanism, which would not constitute a hallucination.\\nTo get a more complete picture, we invoke Doob\\u2019s theorem and note that, when (xi, yi) \\u223cp(x, y | f\\u22c6)\\nand for sufficiently large N, we have\\np(y | x, f\\u22c6) = p(y | x, (xi, yi)\\u221e\\n1 ) \\u2248p(y | x, (xi, yi)N\\n1 ) \\u2248p\\u03b8(y | x, (xi, yi)N\\n1 ).\\n(10)\\n8\\nThis motivates us to estimate the reference THR by approximating the distribution p(y | x, f\\u22c6) with\\np\\u03b8 (y | x, Dn \\u222aDeval), where Deval is a set of additional (xi, yi) examples from the same task that\\nare not in Dn. We call this estimate the model hallucination rate (MHR) as it is derived under the\\nmodel p\\u03b8. Formally,\\nMHR(x; p\\u03b8, Dn, Deval) := 1\\nK\\nK\\nX\\ni=1\\n1\\nn\\nlog p\\u03b8\\n\\u0000yi | x, Dn \\u222aDeval\\n\\u0001\\n< b\\nQeval\\n\\u03f5\\no\\n,\\nwhere yi \\u223cp\\u03b8(y | x, Dn), K is the number of response samples, and b\\nQeval\\n\\u03f5\\nis the \\u03f5 quantile of the\\nsamples\\n\\b\\nlog p\\u03b8\\n\\u0000yj | x, Dn \\u222aDeval\\n\\u0001\\t\\nwith yj \\u223cp\\u03b8(y | x, Dn \\u222aDeval). This value is only proposed\\nfor model evaluation. Importantly, it cannot be used to replace the PHR, as it depends on Deval,\\nwhich is not available at test time. Intuitively, the MHR computes the probability that an answer y,\\ngenerated by a model conditioned on Dn, is considered a hallucination by a model conditioned on\\nboth Dn and Deval.\\nFor each task and context length n \\u2208[2, 4, 8, 16, 32], we sample 50 random training datasets Dn,\\n50 evaluation datasets Deval, and 10 random test samples. We report the same metrics used in the\\nsynthetic experiments, but here we evaluate the PHR as a linear predictor of both the error rate and\\nMHR. These metrics are evaluated over all 50 \\u00d7 10 test samples for each context length.\\nResults. We report results for Llama-2-7b. We set N \\u2212n = 5, M = 10, and K = 50. The top plots\\nin Figure 4 show the MHR and estimated posterior hallucination rate against the number of in-context\\nexamples with \\u03f5 = 0.05. It shows that the posterior hallucination rate is a good estimator of the MHR.\\nWe show that this trend holds for alternative settings of \\u03f5 in Figure 23 of Appendix G.2.2.\\nThe bottom plots in Figure 4 show the empirical error rate and estimated posterior hallucination rate\\nagainst the number of in-context examples with \\u03f5 = 0.75. The plots show that for the SST, Subjective\\nand AG News tasks, the PHR follows the error rate closely, while it diverges for the Medical QP, RTE\\nand WNLI tasks. We use a high value of epsilon so that only responses with very high probability are\\nnot taken to be hallucinations, aligning with our strict focus on correctness rather than modeling the\\nfull distribution. The impact of varying \\u03f5 is explored in Figure 24 of Appendix G.\\nDiscussion. The results highlight the usefulness of the PHR by demonstrating its ability to assess the\\nmodel\\u2019s uncertainty in language tasks and predict its error rate without requiring an evaluation dataset.\\nAdditionally, the discrepancy between the PHR and the error rate in Medical QP, RTE, and WNLI\\ntasks can be attributed to the model\\u2019s limited generalization ability in these tasks. This leads to an\\ninadequate approximation of the posterior predictive; in other words, p\\u03b8(y | x, Dn) \\u0338\\u2248p(y | x, Dn).\\nThis inadequacy is supported by Figure 4, which shows that in tasks where the PHR does not align\\nwith the error rate (green line), the model\\u2019s performance is close to random guessing (dashed gray\\nline). Hence the poor performance of the PHR in this scenarios is expected because our method relies\\non accurately approximating the posterior predictive and only accounts for hallucinations when the\\ndata distribution is properly modeled.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5.2 Extrinsic Evaluation Strategy\",\"section_content\":\"For the extrinsic evaluation, we assess the impact of the reformulated questions on two aspects:\\nAnswer Rate: measured as the percentage of reformulations that obtain an answer.\\nAnswer Relevance: a three-point scale measuring the answer relevance to the original question (obtained from the reformulated questions): Irrelevant (0): answer is not related to $q$ ; Related (1): answer is partially relevant;4 and Exact (2): answer exactly satisfes question\\u2019s information need.\\nEvaluation Data: For the two aspects we measure, we consider the following evaluation datasets:\\n\\u2022 Answer Rate: We randomly sampled 1M unanswered questions by our QA system (see Appendix F for additional details). \\u2022 Answer Relevance: on the same questions used for intrinsic evaluation, the annotators also check the answer relevance w.r.t the original question.\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Discussion\",\"section_content\":\"Discussion\\nWe present NAVSIM, a framework for non-reactive AV simulation. We address shortcomings of\\nexisting driving benchmarks and propose standardized but configurable simulation-based metrics for\\nbenchmarking driving policies. For accessibility, we provide challenging scenario splits and simple\\ndata curation methods. We show that our evaluation protocol is better aligned to closed-loop driving,\\nbenchmark an established set of end-to-end planning baselines from CARLA and nuScenes, and\\npresent the results of our inaugural competition. We hope that NAVSIM can serve as an accessible\\ntoolkit for AV researchers that bridges the gap between simulated and real-world driving.\\nNeed for Reactive Simulation. While we show improvements over displacement errors, several\\naspects of driving remain unaddressed by evaluation in NAVSIM. A high PDMS does not always imply\\na high CLS, since our framework does not consider reactiveness or the compounding accumulation\\n2https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/spaces\\/AGC2024-P\\/e2e-driving-navsim\\n9\\nof errors in closed-loop simulation. Moreover, as in CLS, rear-end collisions into the ego vehicle\\nare currently not classified as \\\"at-fault\\\", resulting in little importance given to the scene behind the\\nvehicle in NAVSIM. In the future, data-driven sensor or traffic simulation could alleviate these issues,\\nonce such methods mature and become computationally tractable. Given these limitations of the\\ncurrent framework, we strongly encourage the use of graphics-based closed-loop simulators, such as\\nCARLA [17], as complementary benchmarks to NAVSIM when developing planning algorithms.\\nSimplicity of Metrics. As a starting point, NAVSIM offers both interpretable open-loop subscores\\nand a scalarizing function, which lets us provide a final score and ranking for participants in the\\nchallenge. In the future, multi-objective evaluation and other aggregation functions might be required.\\nMoreover, closed-loop metrics also face problems, i.e., PDMS inherits several weaknesses of nuPlan\\u2019s\\nCLS. Both scores do not regard certain traffic rules (e.g., stop-sign or traffic light compliance) or\\nconcepts such as transit and fuel efficiency. In the future, we aim to improve the subscore definitions\\n(e.g. the at-fault collision logic) and add more subscores during aggregation.\\nCall for Datasets. Certain limitations of the nuPlan dataset persist in NAVSIM, such as missing\\nclasses in the label space, minor errors in camera parameters, or noise in vehicle poses and 3D\\nannotations. Our analysis might favor methods that are robust to such inconsistencies. In addition,\\nthe lack of road elevation data in our representation presents a challenge for integrating scenarios\\nbased on 3D map annotations. We aim to support more datasets in the future, and advocate for more\\nopen dataset releases by the community for accelerating progress in autonomous driving.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant LEGO-3D (850533), the DFG EXC number\\n2064\\/1 - project number 390727645, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research:\\nT\\u00fcbingen AI Center, FKZ: 01IS18039A and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs\\nand Climate Action within the project NXT GEN AI METHODS.

We evaluated GPT-4o (OpenAI,\\n2023), Llava 1.6 (Liu et al., 2023), Gemini 1.5 (Reid et al., 2024), InternVL2 (Chen et al., 2023)\\nand VideoLlama 2 (Cheng et al., 2024). We evaluated the latest version of each LMM at the time of\\nsubmission. For LIMP, we use Gemini 1.5 Pro as the VLM and GPT-4o as the LLM. Finally, we\\nevaluated BIP-ALM with finetuned Llama 2 (Jin et al., 2024), the best-performing model on a prior\\nmulti-modal ToM benchmark, MMToM-QA.\\nResults We report the human and model performance in Table 2. Human participants achieved\\nalmost perfect accuracy across all questions, with 98.9% of the correct answers having majority\\nagreement. The overall performance averaged across individual participants is 93.5%. The slightly\\nlower performance on social goal inference (94.4%) and belief of goal inference (87.1%) indicates\\nthese questions are more challenging and require greater focus.\\nAll LMM baselines performed poorly on MuMA-ToM, indicating a substantial gap between machine\\nand human ToM. The best-performing LMM baseline is Gemini 1.5 Pro, but its overall accuracy is\\nonly 56.4%. Among the three question types, belief inference is the easiest for LMMs. In particular,\\nLlava 34B achieved the highest accuracy for belief inference. However, all LMMs struggle with the\\nmore challenging social goal inference and belief of goal inference questions. Notably, BIP-ALM had\\nan accuracy of 33.9%, indicating its inability to understand multi-agent interactions. Our LIMP model\\nsignificantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models on our benchmark, with an overall accuracy of\\n76.6%. There is still a gap between the best model performance and human performance, highlighting\\nthe need for further studies.\\n6\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

Yet, despite their ever more impressive performance, large-scale neural language models still lack basic theory of mind capabilities out-of-the-box. We posit that simply scaling up models will not imbue them with theory of mind due to the inherently symbolic and implicit nature of the phenomenon, and instead investigate an alternative: can we design a decoding-time algorithm that enhances theory of mind of off-the-shelf neural language models without explicit supervision? We present SYMBOLICTOM, a plug-andplay approach to reason about the belief states of multiple characters in reading comprehension tasks via explicit symbolic representation. More concretely, our approach tracks each entity\\u2019s beliefs, their estimation of other entities\\u2019 beliefs, and higher-order levels of reasoning, all through graphical representations, allowing for more precise and interpretable reasoning than previous approaches. Empirical results on the well-known ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019) demonstrate that SYMBOLICTOM dramatically enhances off-the-shelf neural networks\\u2019 theory of mind in a zero-shot setting while showing robust out-of-distribution performance compared to supervised baselines. Our work also reveals spurious patterns in existing theory of mind benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of out-of-distribution evaluation and methods that do not overft a particular dataset.\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
