{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

With LLMs\\nbeing increasingly applied in diverse task domains, domain-specific fine-tuning has emerged as a\\ncritical strategy to enhance their downstream capabilities [2, 3, 4, 5]. Nevertheless, these methods\\nare typically time-intensive and consume substantial computational resources, posing significant\\nchallenges to the development of large-scale models [6]. For example, continual pre-training typically\\n*Equal Contribution.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nrequires several weeks even with multiple 80 GB GPUs.

Among these, LoRA stands out\\nas one of the most widely adopted due to its unique ability\\nto merge the adaptor back into the base model parameters,\\nsignificantly enhancing efficiency. However, LoRA\\u2019s su-\\nperior performance in fine-tuning tasks has yet to reach a\\npoint that universally surpasses full parameter fine-tuning\\nin all settings [10, 11]. In particular, it has been observed\\nthat LoRA tends to falter on large-scale datasets during\\ncontinual pre-training [12], which raises doubts about the\\neffectiveness of LoRA under those circumstances. We at-\\ntribute this to LoRA\\u2019s much fewer trainable parameters\\ncompared to the base model, which limits the representa-\\ntion power of LoRA training.\\nTo overcome this shortcoming, we delve into LoRA\\u2019s training statistics in each layer, aspiring to\\nbridge the difference between LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we discover\\nthat LoRA\\u2019s layerwise weight norms have an uncommonly skewed distribution, where the bottom\\nlayer and\\/or the top layer occupy the majority of weights during the update. In contrast, the other\\nself-attention layers only account for a small amount, which means different layers have different\\nimportance when updating. This key observation inspires us to \\u201csample\\u201d different layers by their\\nimportance, which matches the idea of importance sampling [13, 14].\\nAs a natural consequence, this strategy brings forth our Layerwise Importance Sampled Adam (LISA)\\nalgorithm, where by selectively updating only essential LLM layers and leaving others untouched,\\nLISA enables training large-scale language models (\\u226565B parameters) with less or similar memory\\nconsumption as LoRA.

In addition, LISA exhibits much better convergence behaviors than LoRA.\\nLISA even outperforms full parameters training under certain settings. Similar performance\\ngain is observed across different sized models (7B-70B) and tasks, including instruction\\nfollowing, medical QA, and math problems.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\n2.1\\nLarge Language Models\\nIn the realm of natural language processing (NLP), the Transformer architecture has been a revolu-\\ntionary technique, initially known for its effectiveness in machine translation tasks [15]. With the\\ninception of models like BERT [16] and GPT-2 [17], the approach shifted towards pre-training on\\nextensive corpora, which led to significant performance enhancements in downstream fine-tuning\\ntasks [2, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. However, the growing number of parameters in these\\nmodels results in a huge GPU memory consumption, rendering the fine-tuning of large scale models\\n(\\u226565B) infeasible under low resource scenarios. This has prompted a shift towards more efficient\\ntraining of LLMs.\\n2\\n2.2\\nParameter-Effieient Fine-Tuning\\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods adapt pre-trained models by fine-tuning only a\\nsubset of parameters. In general, PEFT methods can be grouped into three classes: 1) Prompt\\nLearning methods [8, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], 2) Adapter methods [7, 9, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], and\\n3) Selective methods [39, 39, 40, 41]. Prompt learning methods emphasize optimizing the input\\ntoken or input embedding with frozen model parameters, which generally has the least training\\ncost among all three types. Adapter methods normally introduce an auxiliary module with much\\nfewer parameters than the original model, and updates are only applied to the adapter module during\\ntraining. Compared with them, selective methods are more closely related to LISA, which focuses on\\noptimizing a fraction of the model\\u2019s parameters without appending extra modules. Recent advances\\nin this domain have introduced several notable techniques through layer freezing. AutoFreeze [39]\\noffers an adaptive mechanism to identify layers for freezing automatically and accelerates the training\\nprocess. FreezeOut [42] progressively freezes intermediate layers, significantly reducing training\\ntime without notably affecting accuracy. The SmartFRZ [40] framework utilizes an attention-based\\npredictor for layer selection, substantially cutting computation and training time while maintaining\\naccuracy. However, none of these layer-freezing strategies has been widely adopted in the context of\\nLarge Language Models due to their inherent complexity or non-compatibility with modern memory\\nreduction techniques [43, 44, 27] for LLMs.\\n2.3\\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\\nIn contrast, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique is much more prevalent in common LLM\\ntraining [9]. LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by employing low-rank matrices,\\nthereby lessening the computational burden and memory cost. One key strength of LoRA is its\\ncompatibility with models featuring linear layers, where the decomposed low-rank matrices can be\\nmerged back into the original model. This allows for efficient deployment without changing the\\nmodel architecture. As a result, LoRA can be seamlessly combined with other techniques, such as\\nquantization [11] or Mixture of Experts [45]. Despite these advantages, LoRA\\u2019s performance is not\\nuniversally comparable with full parameter fine-tuning. There have been tasks in [10] that LoRA\\nperforms much worse than full parameter training on. This phenomenon is especially evident in\\nlarge-scale pre-training settings [12], where to the best of our knowledge, only full parameter training\\nwas adopted for successful open-source LLMs [21, 22, 23, 46, 47, 26, 27].\\n2.4\\nLarge-scale Optimization Algorithms\\nIn addition to approaches that change model architectures, there have also been efforts to improve\\nthe efficiency of optimization algorithms for LLMs. One such approach is layerwise optimization, a\\nconcept with roots extending back several decades. Notably, [48] introduced an effective layer-by-\\nlayer pre-training method for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), demonstrating the benefits of sequential\\nlayer optimization. This idea was expanded by researchers like [49, 50], who illustrated the advantages\\nof a greedy, unsupervised approach to pre-training each layer of deep networks. In the context of\\nlarge batch training, [51, 52] developed LARS and LAMB to improve generalization and mitigate the\\nperformance declines associated with large batch sizes. Despite these innovations, Adam [53, 54,\\n55, 27] and AdamW [56] continue to be the predominant optimization methods used in most LLM\\nsettings.\\nRecently, other attempts have also been made to reduce the training cost of LLMs. For example,\\nMeZO [57] adopted zeroth order optimization, bringing significant memory savings during training.\\nHowever, it also incurred a considerable performance drop in multiple benchmarks, particularly in\\ncomplex fine-tuning scenarios. Regarding acceleration, Sophia [58] incorporates clipped second-order\\ninformation into the optimization, obtaining non-trivial speedup on LLM training. The significant\\ndownsides are its intrinsic complexity of Hessian estimation and unverified empirical performance in\\nlarge-size models (e.g., \\u226565B). In parallel to our work, [59] proposed GaLore, a memory-efficient\\ntraining strategy that reduces memory cost by projecting gradients into a low-rank compact space.\\nYet the performance has still not surpassed full-parameter training in fine-tuning settings. To sum up,\\nLoRA-variant methods [9, 11, 59] with AdamW [56] is still the dominant paradigm for large-size\\nLLM fine-tuning, the performance of which still demands further improvements.\\n3\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Method\\n3.1\\nMotivation\\nTo understand how LoRA achieves effective training with only a few parameters, we conducted\\nempirical studies on multiple models, especially observing the weight norms across various layers.\\nWe fine-tune it on the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset [60].

For example, in\\nembedding layers, tokens with similar meanings, i.e., synonyms, can be projected into the same\\nembedding space and converted to similar embeddings. LoRA may capture this similarity in language\\nand \\u201cgroup\\u201d them in the low-dimension space, allowing frequent features of language meanings to be\\npromptly identified and optimized. The price is LoRA\\u2019s limited representation power restricted by its\\nintrinsic low-rank space, as we can see from the comparison with LISA in image generation tasks\\n(Appendix A.1), where LoRA memorizes and learns details much slower than LISA. Other possible\\nexplanations can also justify this phenomenon. Despite various interpretations of this observation,\\none fact remains clear: LoRA values layerwise importance differently from full parameter tuning.\\n3.2\\nLayerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA)\\nTo exploit the discovery above, we aspire to simulate LoRA\\u2019s updating pattern via sampling different\\nlayers to freeze. This way, we can avoid LoRA\\u2019s inherent deficiency of limited low-rank representation\\nability and emulate its fast learning process. Intuitively, given the same global learning rates across\\nlayers, layers with small weight norms in LoRA should also have small sampling probabilities to\\nunfreeze in full-parameter settings so the expected learning rates across iterations can stay the same.\\nThis is exactly the idea of importance sampling [13, 14], where instead of applying layerwise different\\nlearning rates {\\u03b7t} in full-parameter settings to emulate LoRA\\u2019s updates {\\u02dc\\n\\u03b7t}, we apply sampling\\nand instead get the same expected parameter update\\n\\u03b7(\\u2113)\\nt\\n= \\u02dc\\n\\u03b7(\\u2113)\\nt\\n\\u00b7 \\u02dc\\nw(\\u2113)\\nw(\\u2113)\\n\\u21d2\\n\\u03b7(\\u2113)\\nt\\n= \\u03b7(\\u2113), p(\\u2113) = \\u02dc\\nw(\\u2113)\\nw(\\u2113)\\n4\\nThis gives rise to our Layerwise Importance Sampling AdamW method, as illustrated in Algorithm 1.\\nIn practice, since all layers except the bottom and top layer have small weight norms in LoRA,\\nwe adopt {p\\u2113}NL\\n\\u2113=1 = {1.0, \\u03b3\\/NL, \\u03b3\\/NL, . . . , \\u03b3\\/NL, 1.0} in practice, where \\u03b3 controls the expected\\nnumber of unfreeze layers during optimization, and the embedding layer E and head layer H remain\\nactive.
