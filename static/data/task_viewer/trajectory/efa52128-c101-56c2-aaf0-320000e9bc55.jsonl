{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

To address this issue, grammar-\\nconstrained decoding (GCD) can be used to\\ncontrol the generation of LMs, guaranteeing\\nthat the output follows a given structure. Most\\nexisting GCD methods are, however, limited to\\nspecific tasks, such as parsing or code genera-\\ntion. In this work, we demonstrate that formal\\ngrammars can describe the output space for a\\nmuch wider range of tasks and argue that GCD\\ncan serve as a unified framework for structured\\nNLP tasks in general. For increased flexibil-\\nity, we introduce input-dependent grammars,\\nwhich allow the grammar to depend on the in-\\nput and thus enable the generation of different\\noutput structures for different inputs. We then\\nempirically demonstrate the power and flexi-\\nbility of GCD-enhanced LMs on (1) informa-\\ntion extraction, (2) entity disambiguation, and\\n(3) constituency parsing. Our results indicate\\nthat grammar-constrained LMs substantially\\noutperform unconstrained LMs or even beat\\ntask-specific finetuned models.

More\\nrecently, the scaling of language models to larger\\nsizes has introduced notable in-context learning\\ncapabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al.,\\n2019; Schick and Sch\\u00fctze, 2021), such that large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) can quickly and effec-\\ntively adapt to new tasks even without finetuning,\\nwhen shown only few demonstrations as part of\\ntheir context.\\nCertain important tasks, however, such as closed\\ninformation extraction (cIE), entity disambiguation\\n(ED), or constituency parsing (CP), require the out-\\nput to follow a predefined format and adhere to\\n10932\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"a restricted vocabulary (entities, relations, senses,\\ndependency labels, etc.). Whereas LMs excel at\\ngenerating free-form text, they are not specifically\\ndesigned for structured prediction tasks where only\\na small subset of the output space is valid. Conse-\\nquently, structured prediction tasks present unique\\nchallenges because constrained output spaces de-\\nmand both structural coherence and compliance\\nwith a predefined vocabulary. For instance, Josi-\\nfoski et al. (2023) have demonstrated that few-shot-\\nprompted large language models such as GPT-3.5\\nstruggle with tasks such as cIE. This difficulty is\\nprimarily due to the extensive output vocabulary,\\nwhich includes 2.7 million Wikidata entity names\\nand approximately 1,000 Wikidata relation names,\\nwhich is too vast to be conveyed with just a few\\ndemonstration examples.\\nOne way forward is to finetune LMs for spe-\\ncific tasks, which involves linearizing the desired\\noutput format into a string format, thus enabling\\ntraining through standard next-token prediction.\\nFor instance, De Cao et al. (2021) and Josifoski\\net al. (2022) successfully applied this technique\\nto ED and cIE, respectively. However, this ap-\\nproach has limitations: it necessitates an expen-\\nsive finetuning pipeline for each new task, which\\nlacks flexibility and requires bespoke training data.\\nOrthogonally, constrained decoding (Tromble and\\nEisner, 2006) is a technique that can be used\\nto enforce constraints on the output space of\\nan autoregressive language model during infer-\\nence. Constrained decoding has been used in se-\\nmantic role labeling (Deutsch et al., 2019), con-\\nstituency parsing (Deutsch et al., 2019), code gen-\\neration (Scholak et al., 2021), and entity disam-\\nbiguation (De Cao et al., 2021). The constraints\\nhave been expressed in the form of finite-state au-\\ntomata (Deutsch et al., 2019) or trie-based data\\nstructures for fast lookup (De Cao et al., 2021).\\nIn this work, we show that, for a much wider\\nrange of NLP tasks, the respective output space can\\nbe described with a formal grammar, giving rise\\nto a unified framework for structured NLP tasks.\\nGiven an appropriately defined grammar, we use\\nan incremental parser to play the role of a com-\\npletion engine, which determines the set of valid\\nnext tokens given the current prefix. We integrate\\nthis completion engine with a pretrained language\\nmodel to iteratively generate sequences that are\\nvalid according to the grammar and plausible ac-\\ncording to the LM (cf. Fig. 1). From a practical\\nperspective, the grammar-constrained decoding\\n(GCD) framework allows researchers to focus on\\nwriting the grammar while ignoring the implemen-\\ntation details of the constrained decoding process.\\nThis is in contrast to previous work, where the con-\\nstraints were expressed in the form of finite-state\\nautomata or trie-based data structures, which re-\\nquire a significant engineering effort to implement.\\nWe envision GCD to be as simple to use as regular\\nexpressions, in the sense that the user can specify a\\ndesired output structure in a declarative way, and\\nthe LM-generated sequences will be guaranteed to\\nbe valid. With the introduction of input-dependent\\ngrammars, the scope of tasks that can be tackled\\nwith GCD can be further extended to tasks such as\\nentity disambiguation and entity linking, where the\\noutput space is not fixed but depends on the input.\\nWe show that, by combining GCD with powerful\\nLLMs, we achieve remarkable improvements with\\nfew-shot learning, even rivaling the performance of\\nfinetuned task-specific models. This is particularly\\nexciting because it shows that LMs can be used to\\nsolve a much wider range of structured tasks than\\nbefore, without the need for finetuning.\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n1. We demonstrate that the output spaces of\\nmany structured NLP tasks can be formulated\\nas formal languages, thus converting the tasks\\ninto grammar-constrained decoding problems.\\nThis formulation provides a unified frame-\\nwork to tackle structured NLP tasks.\\n2. We introduce input-dependent grammars,\\nwhich extend the set of tasks that can be tack-\\nled with GCD. We show that this can be useful,\\namong others, for tasks such as ED and CP.\\n3. Through empirical experiments, we demon-\\nstrate the effectiveness of GCD on three struc-\\ntured NLP tasks: cIE, ED, and CP. We show\\nthat our method can achieve competitive re-\\nsults on cIE and ED without any finetuning.\\n2\\nMethod\\nWe now describe GCD and how it can constrain the\\noutput of LMs at decoding time based on a formal\\ngrammar.

Whereas the input x is usually\\narbitrary, for many tasks the output y needs to fol-\\nlow a specific structure. For instance, in informa-\\ntion extraction, y is required to consist of subject\\u2013\\nrelation\\u2013object triplets (cf. Fig. 1). Since formal\\nlanguages provide a rigorous and complete frame-\\nwork for describing the structure of any computable\\nset of object (according to the Church\\u2013Turing the-\\nsis), they offer a promising way to define the output\\nspaces of structured NLP tasks. In order to define\\nthe formal languages corresponding to the output\\nspaces of structured NLP tasks, our framework re-\\nlies on formal grammars, a universal formalism that\\ncan describe any formal language. For tractability,\\nwe focus on the class of context-free grammars.\\nToken-level formal grammars. A formal gram-\\nmar G is defined as a tuple (V,\\u03a3,P,S) where\\n\\u2022 V is a finite set of non-terminal symbols,\\n\\u2022 \\u03a3 is a finite set of terminal symbols,\\n\\u2022 P is a finite set of production rules,\\n\\u2022 S \\u2208V is the start symbol.\\nWe illustrate the suitability of formal grammars\\nfor specifying the output spaces of structured NLP\\ntasks in Fig. 2 using 14 common tasks as examples.\\nIn our approach, the user first writes a formal\\ngrammar G over characters. In order to obtain a\\ntoken-level grammar Gtok that can be used to con-\\nstrain the direct output of LMs\\u2014token sequences\\u2014\\nwe use the token set \\u03a3tok as terminal symbols and\\napply the tokenizer to the sequences of terminal\\nsymbols appearing in the rules P, obtaining the\\ntoken-level rules P\\ntok. This yields the token-level\\ngrammar Gtok = (V,\\u03a3tok,P\\ntok,S), which describes\\nthe same language as the character-level grammar\\nG. We then use an incremental parser (see below)\\nto decide whether a token sequence y is in the lan-\\nguage generated by Gtok.\\nDespite its simplicity, this approach has some\\nlimitations.\\nWidely used tokenization methods\\nsuch as BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) allow the same\\nstring to be tokenized in different ways. For ex-\\nample, the string \\u201c[[[\\u201d can be tokenized as \\u201c[[\\n[\\u201d, \\u201c[[[\\u201d or \\u201c[ [ [\\u201d, all of which would be\\ndetokenized to the original string \\u201c[[[\\u201d. To avoid\\nthis ambiguity, we can add extra spaces between\\nthe brackets in the grammar and force the single\\nbracket to be a token. This approach is, however,\\nnot principled and relies on a specific tokenizer.\\nWe therefore believe that a principled approach\\nfor defining token-level grammars is an interesting\\ndirection for future work.\\nGrammatical Framework. Since the token-level\\ngrammar Gtok is tokenizer-dependent, there are in\\ngeneral multiple token-level grammars for the same\\ngrammar G. This one-to-many mapping from a\\ncharacter-level grammar to a token-level grammar\\nis analogous to the one-to-many mapping from ab-\\nstract syntax trees to different programming lan-\\nguages. For this reason, we adopt Grammatical\\nFramework (GF) (Ranta, 2019) to define both the\\ngrammar G and the token-level grammar Gtok. GF\\nis a meta-language for multilingual grammar appli-\\ncations, which allows us to define an abstract gram-\\nmar as well as concrete grammars for linearizing\\n10934\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"abstract syntax trees into different tokenizer-spe-\\ncific \\u201clanguages\\u201d. In our case, the abstract grammar\\nis the character-level grammar G and the concrete\\ngrammars are the token-level grammars for differ-\\nent tokenizers.\\nInput-dependent grammars (IDG). While the\\noutput of many NLP tasks can be described by a\\nformal grammar, some tasks require a grammar that\\nis dependent on the input sequence. For example,\\nin entity dismbiguation, the output needs to be con-\\nstrained to the set of entity candidates, which usu-\\nally contains dozens of entity names semantically\\nrelated to the target mention in the input sequence.\\nIn constituency parsing, outputs are parse trees\\nwhose terminal nodes are the input tokens. These\\ntwo tasks both require a grammar that is dependent\\non the input. Existing work has focused on using a\\nsingle grammar to constrain the decoding regard-\\nless of the input sequence. Whereas this is suitable\\nfor tasks where the output space is independent of\\nthe input sequence, such as code generation (Poesia\\net al., 2022) or information extraction (Josifoski\\net al., 2022) (cf. Fig. 1), 13 of the 14 tasks listed\\nin Fig. 2 (those with an asterisk) require an input-\\ndependent grammar.\\n2.2\\nGrammar-constrained decoding (GCD)\\nThe LM decoding process produces tokens one by\\none. To enforce the formal grammar, we intervene\\nduring decoding by pruning the probability distri-\\nbution to include only the subset of tokens that are\\nallowed by the formal grammar. The subset of al-\\nlowed tokens is returned by an incremental parser,\\nwhich takes the partially generated sequence and\\nthe formal grammar as inputs and returns the set\\nof next allowed tokens. The role of the parser can\\nbe abstracted as a completion engine (Poesia et al.,\\n2022), which derives completion candidates from\\nthe partial sequence and the formal grammar G. In\\nthis work, we use the incremental parser of Gram-\\nmatical Framework (Angelov, 2009) as the comple-\\ntion engine. This process is compatible with any\\ndecoding algorithm, including greedy decoding,\\nbeam search, top-k sampling, etc. GCD can also\\nbe applied to any autoregressive language model,\\nprovided that we have access to the distribution\\nover the vocabulary at each decoding step. Since\\nAPI-based services such as OpenAI do not provide\\naccess to the distribution over the vocabulary, they\\ncannot be used with GCD.\\n2.3\\nFew-shot learning with GCD\\nTo adapt a pretrained LM to a new task, one can\\neither finetune the LM on task-specific training\\ndata or use few-shot learning if the LM is powerful\\nenough. In this work, we use GCD in conjunc-\\ntion with few-shot learning to adapt a pretrained\\nlarge LM (LLM) to new tasks. Instead of prompt-\\ning the LLM to generate free-form text, we use\\nGCD to constrain the output to be grammatically\\ncorrect. This allows us to leverage the LLM\\u2019s few-\\nshot learning capability together with the grammar-\\ninduced knowledge of the task\\u2019s output structure.\\nFor the same task, we can use different grammars\\nto constrain the output of the LLM. For example,\\nin entity disambiguation, we can use a grammar\\nG1 that depends on the input sequence to constrain\\nthe output to the input-specific candidate set, or\\nwe could use a grammar G2 that is independent of\\nthe input to constrain the output to be any valid\\nentity name. While both G1 and G2 can be used to\\nconstrain the output of the LLM, G1 reduces the\\nsearch space more and thus is more effective.\\n3\\nExperimental setup\\nAlthough GCD can be applied to many tasks, we\\nconcentrate on three tasks in order to showcase its\\neffectiveness: closed information extraction (cIE),\\nentity disambiguation (ED), and constituency pars-\\ning (CP). The first two tasks are examples where\\nthe output is restricted to a predefined set of en-\\ntities and relations, while the third is an example\\nof a task where the output is a complex tree struc-\\nture. All three tasks are challenging for LLMs in\\nthe few-shot setting, and we show that GCD can\\nsignificantly improve LLM performance.\\n3.1\\nClosed information extraction (cIE)\\nTask description. The goal of closed information\\nextraction (cIE) is to extract a comprehensive set of\\nfacts from natural-language text. Formally, given\\na knowledge base (KB) containing a collection of\\nentities E and a collection of relations R, the goal\\nis to extract the complete set yset \\u2282E \\u00d7R \\u00d7E of\\nfact triplets from a given input text x.\\nGrammar.
