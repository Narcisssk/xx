{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, the existing stringent policies\\nand regulations pertaining to privacy and security restrict access to the financial tabular datasets of\\ncustomers [5, 6, 7]. Consequently, pseudonymized or anonymized datasets are often employed to\\nmitigate these concerns [8, 9], as illustrated in Fig. 1a. However, the limited availability of public\\ndatasets and the alteration of their original distributions through anonymization or pseudonymization\\npose significant challenges in the accurate representation of real-world scenarios. This shortage of\\nauthentic and accessible financial datasets impedes the advancement of artificial intelligence models\\nfor various financial tasks, including anti-money laundering and business confidence indices [10, 11].\\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as the GPT series [19, 20], exhibit remarkable proficiency in\\ncomprehending and generating texts for a wide range of tasks [21, 22, 23], including data construction\\n\\u2217Equal contribution\\n\\u2020Corresponding author\\nTable Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2024\\nAccessible\\nRealistic\\nPersonal data\\nPseudo\\nfinancial data\\nAnonymous\\ndata\\nPseudonymous\\ndata\\n(a) Comparison of financial data\\nDomain knowledge & LLMs\\nLLMs\\nPseudo\\nfinancial data\\nAnonymous data\\nPersonal data\\nPseudonymous\\ndata\\nName:\\nJ764566\\nBirth:\\nx1.j4.874f\\nIncome:\\nncome:\\nCS:\\n975\\nName:\\nJane Doe\\nBirth:\\n13.07.1975\\nIncome: $35,460\\nCS:\\n975\\nName:\\nLuna\\nBirth:\\n18.09.1997\\nIncome: $37,640\\nCS:\\n995\\nAge:\\n37~50\\nIncome: $30,000\\n~$40,000\\nCS:\\n900~1,000\\n(b) Example of pseudo-financial data\\nFigure 1: Comparative Analysis of Financial Data: (a) The y-axis represents the degree to which the\\ndata resembles authentic data from financial institutions, whereas the x-axis denotes accessibility.

Despite the impressive generative capabilities of LLMs, sig-\\nnificant challenges remain in the generation and enhancement of financial tabular datasets, stemming\\nfrom the intricate attribute relationships and diverse data ranges inherent in financial services [8, 29].\\nIn this study, we address the deficiency of public financial tabular datasets and propose a novel\\napproach termed the expertise-centric prompting (ECP) framework. Our ECP framework involves\\na collaboration between financial experts and pre-trained LLMs. The framework integrates two\\nessential components into in-context learning: 1) schema calibration, which assesses the alignment\\nof LLMs with primitive financial attribute prompts, and 2) attribute constraints, which produce\\nbalanced instances that closely resemble real-world financial data, as depicted in Fig. 1b. With this\\nframework, we can generate pseudo-financial datasets, as illustrated in Fig. 1a, which are realistic\\nand accessible. Furthermore, combining experts and LLMs, our framework enables the creation of\\nunique multilingual datasets with new attributes not found in public datasets, as shown in Table 1.\\nAlong with the ECP framework, we also propose two evaluation metrics for assessing the realism\\nof the generated datasets. When evaluating the outputs from generative language models, metrics\\nsuch as ROUGE [30], BERTscore [31], BLEURT [32], and COMET-22 [33] have been employed.\\nHowever, evaluation metrics that are specifically tailored to synthetic tabular datasets in the financial\\ndomain have not yet been developed. To assess the realism of financial datasets, we introduce two\\nevaluation techniques: one for assessing dataset diversity, encompassing inter-instance and intra-\\nattribute diversities, and another for evaluating numeric constraint satisfaction. Our findings reveal\\nthat the collaboration between superior pre-trained LLMs and experts, facilitated by the proposed\\nECP framework, consistently produces superior results according to the proposed metrics.\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 In this paper, we propose an expertise-centric prompting (ECP) framework to generate\\npseudo-financial tabular datasets, addressing the limited accessibility of realistic financial\\ndata.\\n\\u2022 We introduce novel evaluation metrics to assess the diversity of the generated financial\\ntabular datasets and the confidence level in constraint satisfaction.\\n\\u2022 This paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed ECP framework and evaluation metrics\\non both English and Korean financial contexts across three distinct data types.\\n2\\nLLMs\\n(\\na\\n)\\n \\nE\\nx\\np\\ne\\nr\\nt\\ni\\ns\\ne\\n-\\nC\\ne\\nn\\nt\\nr\\ni\\nc\\n \\nP\\nr\\no\\nm\\np\\nt\\ni\\nn\\ng\\nConstructed\\nDatasets\\nS\\nc\\nh\\ne\\nm\\na\\n \\nDate\\nAmount\\nMerchant\\nSchema Calibaration\\nDate \\n'\\nAmount\\nMechant\\nInquiry Type Online pay\\nRegular pay\\n07.08 \\n$45.49\\nNetflix\\nOnline\\nApple Pay\\nOTT\\nDate \\nMerchant\\nInquiry Type Online Pay\\nRegular Pay\\nRatio of Point\\nPoint\\n0.002\\n$0.09098\\n07.08 \\n$45.49\\nNetflix\\nOnline\\nApple Pay\\nOTT\\n0.002\\n$0.17998\\n09.01\\n$89.99\\nGym\\nOnline\\nVenmo\\nY\\n\\u2219\\u2219\\u2219\\n0.001\\n$0.220199\\n10.21\\n$201.99\\nNike\\nOffline\\n-\\n-\\nAmount\\nR\\ne\\np\\ne\\na\\nt\\n1\\n2\\n3\\nConstraints on financial attributes\\nExample generation\\nE\\nx\\np\\ne\\nr\\nt\\n\\u2019\\ns\\n \\nP\\nr\\no\\nm\\np\\nt\\n(\\nb\\n)\\n \\nC\\na\\nl\\ni\\nb\\nr\\na\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\na\\nn\\nd\\n \\nC\\no\\nn\\ns\\nt\\nr\\na\\ni\\nn\\nt\\ns\\nP\\ns\\ne\\nu\\nd\\no\\n-\\nF\\ni\\nn\\na\\nn\\nc\\ni\\na\\nl\\nD\\na\\nt\\na\\nS\\nc\\nh\\ne\\nm\\na\\n \\nE\\nx\\na\\nm\\np\\nl\\ne\\n+\\nS\\nc\\nh\\ne\\nm\\na\\n \\nE\\nx\\na\\nm\\np\\nl\\ne\\n+\\nC\\no\\nn\\ns\\nt\\nr\\na\\ni\\nn\\nt\\ns\\n+\\na\\nn\\nd\\n(\\nc\\n)\\n \\np\\nr\\no\\nm\\np\\nt\\n \\n:\\np\\nr\\no\\nm\\np\\nt\\n \\n:\\np\\nr\\no\\nm\\np\\nt\\n \\n:\\nFigure 2: Overview of our expertise-centric prompting framework\\n2\"}\n{\"page_number\":17,\"page_content\":\"E\\nCase Study: Application of Pseudo-Financial Datasets in Generative AI\\nService\\nFigures 5 and 6 present a case study conducted by KakaoBank, an internet-only bank in South Korea,\\nutilizing the methodology proposed in this paper.

In contrast, SelfCheckGPT [42]\\nidentifies hallucinations by cross-referencing multiple outputs for consistency.In the finance domain,\\nFinLMEval [43] proposes an evaluation metric tailored to appraise the performance of LLMs, with a\\nparticular emphasis on financial classification tasks. Unlike prior methods, our approach assesses\\nthe quality of LLM-generated financial datasets by distinguishing between numeric and categorical\\ndata, evaluating dataset diversity for the first time. We also introduce metrics to measure constraint\\nsatisfaction confidence, crucial for producing realistic and accurate data.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
